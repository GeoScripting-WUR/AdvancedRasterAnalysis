## [Advanced Raster Analysis](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/AdvancedRasterAnalysis/)

R tutorial written for the [geoScripting] course taught at Wageningen University that explains how to deal with more advanced raster analysis and publishing a html report based on the analysis:

  - carry out a supervised and unsupervised classification on a series of raster layers
  - construct a raster sieve using the `clump()` function
  - deal with thematic (catergorical maps)
